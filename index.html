			</p>
			<p>
				Name: Alex Barron <br /> Student Number: s3831619 <br /> Email
				Address: s3831619@student.rmit.edu.au <br /> <br /> I'm originally
				from the UK and came to Australia in 2011 for a holiday, a few
				months later I moved here permanently with my wife and we are now
				Australian and British citizens. <br /> I left school in the UK
				with GCSE's and A-levels taking a gap year before university working
				for a company that manufactured trucks. I ended up staying there and
				learned a lot about many different areas in IT and did a lot of
				Sysadmin work. Didn't go through a degree, but did several IT
				vendor-specific qualifications, such as Cisco's CCNP and Microsoft's
				MCSE, that have helped me in my career. <br /> I speak English, but
				I still had to do an English test for my residency :) Thankfully
				they've got rid of that crazy requirement now for native English
				speakers! I studied French for around seven years, but it's been a
				long time since I've used it. <br /> My interesting facts are that
				I love cars, cooking and I have a little five-year-old French
				Bulldog called Molly who is an absolute handful! <br />

			<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			<p>
				I have been interested in IT for as long as I can remember. I used
				to play with computers from a young age, taking an interest in
				coding and how systems work. I had a Commodore, Spectrum ZX, Atari
				ST and an Amiga before I got my first x86 computer. Installing
				Windows 95 from around 26 floppy disks was a personal achievement...
				In my teens, I used to build PCs for family and friends as I enjoyed
				taking things apart and getting them running. <br /> I started
				working in IT in 2001 on the helpdesk looking after a bank of modems
				that connected our dealer network to the mainframe. That job
				involved a lot of turning things off and on again! I've stayed in IT
				since then across a few industries, working for tech vendors for the
				last five years. <br /> I currently am interested in how companies
				are being disrupted by technology. With technologies such as cloud,
				the barrier to entry is much lower. A start-up can have global reach
				with hardly any capital investment. Companies such as Netflix and
				Stan have risen from this and the demise of more traditional
				organisations that didn't adapt, such as Blockbuster are the result.
				Moving forward now, there is a situation where we are hitting the
				limits of streaming services with competition and these companies
				that were disruptors, now have to reinvent themselves to stay ahead.
				Another great example is Uber and the taxi industry, that in
				addition to the technology challenges, have brought ethical
				challenges with its operation.
			</p>
			<p>I chose to come to RMIT as I was looking at a course I could
				study online with a good reputation with an interesting variety of
				topics. I struggle to have fixed periods that are available as I
				travel quite a lot, so this seems to fit well into that.</p>
			<p>My background is in the infrastructure space; servers,
				storage, networking, security etc. Whilst I have some knowledge
				around systems and coding, its far from my area of specialism. I'm
				hoping to gain a greater appreciation of this space and side of IT
				through the course.</p>

			<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
			<h5>The role</h5>
			<p>
				Looking at some of the roles available, my ideal job would be a
				Technical Solutions Engineer (TSE) at Google. <br /> The job can be
				viewed at <a target="_blank"
					href="https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/115831498520568518/">https://careers.google.com/jobs/results/115831498520568518/</a>

					width="20%" src="assets/images/idealjob3.png" alt="Screenshot 3">
				</a> <br />
			</p>
			<h5>Skills required</h5>
			<p>
				This role involves working with customers to resolve their issues
				across Google technologies. It is a global role that involves
				working across a variety of industries and companies. What makes
				this appealing to me is that it is a cross-functional role that
				requires a wide range of both technical and soft skills. This offers
				a varied work environment with the opportunity to make an impact in
				the growth market of the cloud. <br /> The skills that are needed
				are:
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li>Bachelor's degree in the field of Science, Technology,
					Engineering, Math or equivalent practical experience in technical
					support, professional services, software development, or product
					operations management.</li>
				<li>Experience reading or debugging in one or more of the
					following: Java, C, C++, .NET, Python, Shell, Perl, JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Experience in advocating for customer issues or needs.</li>
				<li>Experience as a system/network administrator working with
					Linux/Unix or Windows systems, from Kernel to Shell, file systems,
					and client-server protocols.</li>
				<li>Experience with Kubernetes, system virtualization, on-prem
					and/or hybrid cloud computing, cloud Identity and security system,
					cloud monitoring and logging, and/or local/cloud storage.</li>
				<li>Experience with SQL database administration, Google App
					Engine, open-source software communities, Cloud networking
					solutions, and/or distributed computing technology.</li>
				<li>Experience in computer networking. Understanding of web
					technologies.</li>
				<li>Ability to quickly prioritize multiple tasks in a
					fast-paced environment.</li>
				<li>Excellent attention to detail, troubleshooting, and written
					and verbal communication skills.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h5>Skills gap</h5>
			<p>Having worked in IT for a number of years, I have technical
				skills in System administration, networking, virtualisation and web
				technologies. I also have soft skills working with customers and
				organising my time and troubleshooting technical issues. I have
				compared my skills to the requirements below using a traffic light
				system.
			<ul style="list-style-type: circle">
				<li style="color: red">Bachelor's degree in the field of
					Science, Technology, Engineering or Math.</li>
				<li style="color: orange">Experience reading or debugging in
					one or more of the following: Java, C, C++, .NET, Python, Shell,
					Perl, JavaScript.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Experience in advocating for customer
					issues or needs.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Experience as a system/network
					administrator working with Linux/Unix or Windows systems, from
					Kernel to Shell, file systems, and client-server protocols.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Experience with Kubernetes, system
					virtualization, on-prem and/or hybrid cloud computing, cloud
					Identity and security system, cloud monitoring and logging, and/or
					local/cloud storage.</li>
				<li style="color: orange">Experience with SQL database
					administration, Google App Engine, open-source software
					communities, Cloud networking solutions, and/or distributed
					computing technology.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Experience in computer networking.
					Understanding of web technologies.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Ability to quickly prioritize multiple
					tasks in a fast-paced environment.</li>
				<li style="color: green">Excellent attention to detail,
					troubleshooting, and written and verbal communication skills.</li>
			</ul>
			<br /> This shows where my gaps are and what I need to develop. I
			plan to address these by completing the following actions:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>Gap: Requirement for Bachelors Degree.
					<ul>
						<li>Achieve bachelors degree through RMIT, Bachelor of
							Information Technology</li>
						<li>This will not only give me the qualification required,
							but also assist with a number of the other skills.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Gap: Experience in more programming languages. I have
					experience currently only in Python.
					<ul>
						<li>Complete RMI-CPT120-2019, Introduction to Programming</li>
						<li>Complete RMI-CPT121-2019, Programming 1</li>
						<li>Complete RMI-CPT230-2019, Software Engineering
							Fundamentals</li>
						<li>Get involved in development and troubleshooting using the
							skills learning in these courses through my existing role.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Gap: Experience in SQL Database administration.
					<ul>
						<li>Complete RMI-CPT140-2019, Database Concepts</li>
						<li>Start listening to SQL Podcasts, such as
							sqlserverradio.com.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			</p>
			<p>I anticipate it will take approximately 4-5 years to gain the
				skills and qualifications required to be ready for this role. During
				this time I will aim to gain "hands-on" experience with these
				technologies to further improve my skills and also have proven
				experience that I can clearly articulate with project examples.</p>

			<h4>Myers-Briggs online test result</h4>
			<p>
				<img src="assets/images/myersbriggs.png"
					alt="Myers Briggs Test Result" width="80%"></img> <br /> Test
				completed from: https://www.16personalities.com <a href="#ref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>When Logisticians say they are going to get something done,
					they do it, meeting their obligations no matter the personal cost,
					and they are baffled by people who don’t hold their own word in the
					same respect. </i>
			</p>

			<h4>Online learning style test result</h4>
			<p>This assessment looks at the preferred learning style
				suggesting how you learn best. There are typically three learning
				styles that are identified, these are;
			<ul>
				<li>Auditory</li>
				<li>Visual</li>
				<li>Tactile/Kinesthetic</li>
			</ul>
			</p>


			<p>
				My responses indicate that my preferred learning style is <i><b>Visual</b></i>.
				Visual learners learn best when information is presented in a
				written language format or in another visual format such as pictures
				or diagrams. The suggestions below can help me to succeed to the
				best of my ability.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Create graphic organizers such as diagrams and concept maps
					that use visual symbols to represent ideas and information.</li>
				<li>Include illustrations as you take notes in class.</li>
				<li>Use highlighter pens of contrasting colors to color code
					different aspects of the information in your textbooks.</li>
				<li>Sit in the front of the class so that you can clearly see
					the teacher. This will allow you to pick up facial expressions and
					body language that provide cues that what your teacher is saying is
					important to write in your notes.</li>
				<li>Study in a place that is free from visual distractions.</li>
				<li>When using flashcards, limit the amount of information on a
					card so that you can form a mental picture of the information.</li>
				<li>Watch videos about topics you are studying in class.</li>
				<li>When hearing a new word you want to remember, visualize its
					spelling.</li>
				<li>When reviewing information, rewrite or draw the information
					from memory.</li>
				<li>When taking notes, replace words with symbols wherever
					possible.</li>
				<li>Type your written notes from class using different fonts,
					bold print, and underlining to make the most important concepts and
					facts visually apparent.</li>
				<li>When solving math problems that involve a sequence of
					steps, draw a series of boxes, each containing the appropriate
					piece of information in sequence.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Big five personality test result</h4>
			<p>This Big Five assessment measures your scores on five major
				dimensions of personality: Openness, Conscientiousness,
				Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes abbreviated
				OCEAN).</p>
			<img src="assets/images/bigfive.png"
				alt="Big Five Personality Test Result" width="50%"></img>
			<p>
				Test completed from:

			</p>

			<h5>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h5>
			<p>I have done a Myers-briggs test before and I have come out as
				ESTJ, which is quite similar. With the big five personality test,
				this is the first time I have done something similar and my results
				do not significantly deviate from the mean. My interpretation from
				the three tests is that I am an analytical person that is methodical
				and visual in learning. I agree with this assessment, I learn much
				better by doing and getting hands-on experience. I have excellent
				execution and can follow through on a plan effectively, however I am
				much less empathetic than others and have little patience for
				time-wasting activities. For the learning style evaluation, I am a
				visual learner and should look to spend more time on practical
				activities and look for reinforcement of data from visual sources.</p>
			<h5>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour
				in a team?</h5>
			<p>When working in a team, this means that I am more likely to
				push for a strong agenda, plan and ensure that we follow through and
				stick to it. This is important to ensure that deadlines are achieved
				and that we are moving in the right direction. However, as a less
				empathetic person, I need to be extremely conscious not to be
				dismissive of others within a team and to ensure that the team is
				inclusive.</p>

			<h5>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h5>
			<p>
				When forming a team, it is important to work with different
				personalities and also to understand the team before starting work.
				As a team, we should understand the personalities and behaviours of
				the team and establish roles and responsibilities. A team of all
				Logisticians will get things done, however will lack things such as
				creativity, which is key in projects to look at other ways to do
				things. Therefore there should be a mix of personalities and
				attitudes in a team. Diversity creates better outcomes.<br /> It is
				also important to hold each other to account within a team if we are
				not behaving as we should, and call each other out. For example, if
				I am dismissive of a team member, I should be called out by the team
				on this.

			<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				My project idea is to create a system to assist people with
				identifying which bin to use in the household. The system will allow
				a user to hold up an object to a camera, which will then show an
				output determining which bin it should be put in. <br /> It will be
				simple to use with a visual indicator that matches to the bin that
				should be used for that particular type of waste. For unknown waste
				types, it should allow the user to input based on their knowledge.
				With enough people using the system, it will improve its learning
				via this feedback loop to give 90%+ accuracy. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
				The motivation for this is that councils are cracking down on waste
				being put into the wrong bin. A recent article in the West
				Australian discusses how local councils are signing up to a waste
				tagging scheme which could result in uncollected bins for
				non-compliant residents <br /> <br /> <i><b>"Households
						that are cross-contaminating by not putting the accepted items in
						the right bins, such as food scraps into the recycling, are being
						shamed with stickers of an unhappy face for non-compliance and
						risk their bins being taped up and uncollected."</b></i> <a href="#ref5"><sup>[5]</sup></a><br />
				<br />
			</p>

			<p>
				The product will run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera attached to the
				header. The user then shows the camera the item they are unsure
				about which bin it should go in. <br /> The system would take a
				picture of the item shown, submit this to a trained machine-learning
				model locally, which would return a result of which bin to place it
				into with a confidence level. <i>The reason for using a local
					machine-learning model is to reduce the latency of the response and
					therefore improve the user experience. </i> <br /> If the confidence
				level is above 90% then it can provide a visual indication to the
				user via a coloured LED that corresponds with the colour of the bin
				lid. <br /> This does, rely on the user to place the item in the
				correct bin; however, this reduces the requirement for an automated
				sorting system which would require further mechanical engineering to
				put the item in the correct bin. This would be likely
				over-engineering the solution, adding additional cost and complexity
				without any significant benefit. <br /> If the confidence level is
				below the threshold, then it can indicate to the user that they need
				to check the packaging and decide, informing the system of the
				decision with a button press or similar. <br /> This would then
				store the image and the correct tag. This can then be fed back into
				the ML model to retrain and improve the accuracy of this model. With
				multiple households using this system, it will increase the accuracy
				of this device through a larger dataset on which to learn. <br />
				The system would need to check for daily updates, polling a central
				system, to see if there were any updates available to either its
				application files or to the model itself. If there is, then these
				would need to be pulled down. An initial workflow is shown below of
				the operation of the system where a yellow bin is used for recycling
				and a green bin is for household waste; <br /> <br /> <img
					src="assets/images/flowchart.png" alt="System Flow" width="50%"></img>
				<br /> <br /> This diagram shows the steps that would be taken by
				the user and how the information would flow through the system. <br />
				Retraining of the model is key initially to create a model that is
				accurate enough to be reliable. An initial pilot would be required
				to assist with improving the model confidence level prior to any
				large scale roll out. <br /> <br />


			</p>
			<p>
				Using low-cost Raspberry Pi technology and machine-learning this
				will allow a low-cost system to be deployed into the home, with the
				potential to be co-funded by the local council as a green
				initiative. <br /> Tensorflow is an open-source ML framework that
				can be used and also includes TFLite, which allows an edge version
				of the created model to be run on a tool, such as a Raspberry Pi or
				a mobile phone. Cloud can be leveraged to allow rapid model
				iteration at a low cost with edge models deployed to the Raspberry
				Pi for inference. Using hardware such as the Raspberry Pi Zero is
				low cost, includes wifi and can have a camera added for under $100
				AUD. <br /> To achieve a rapid time to value, pre-trained APIs,
				like the Google Cloud Vision API can be used for label detection, an
				example of the label detection capability is below; <br /> <br />
				<img src="assets/images/labeldetect.png" alt="Vision API Detection"
					width="50%"></img> <a href="#ref6"><sup>[6]</sup></a><br /> <br />
				This information can be fed through initially a rules engine, then
				developed with tools such as AutoML
				(https://cloud.google.com/automl/) to use custom tags to build a
				custom model for increased accuracy.
			</p>

			<p>
				To implement the project, it will require a programmer who has
				experience with developing on Raspberry Pi to write the local
				program. It will also require knowledge of TensorFlow and TensorFlow
				lite frameworks. By utilising pre-trained models for labelling and
				tools such as AutoML, that will build the ML model without ML
				knowledge from labels, will assist with these requirements and allow
				a programmer to focus on the initial MVP, rather than requiring a
				Data Scientist. From a hardware perspective, the hardware is
				available off the shelf, however, to make this aesthetically
				pleasing it would be beneficial to 3D print a bespoke case
				containing the Pi, Camera and LED. <br /> As the skills required
				are reasonably generic, and not language-specific, they will likely
				be readily available in the Australian market. <br />
			</p>

			<p>
				The original problem was people don’t always understand what they
				should do with their waste. This device helps them make informed
				choices about how they dispose of their waste, whether landfill or
				recycling. Education of the user is key and this device will assist
				in that. <br /> If the project is successful, the outcome will be
				an improved rate of recycling. The 2018 Australian national Waste
				Report shows that in 2016-2017, 67 million tonnes of waste was
				generated, with 37 million tonnes recycled, approximately 55%.<a
					href="#ref7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The usage of this device could
				significantly improve that number by reducing the contamination of
				recycled waste and also the amount of waste sent to landfill.
